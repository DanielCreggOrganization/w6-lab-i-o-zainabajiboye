## 1. Project Setup

### Concept Introduction: Java Project Structure

In Java development, organizing your code into projects and packages is crucial for maintainability and scalability. A typical Java project structure includes:

- **Project**: The top-level container for all your code and resources.
- **Packages**: Directories that group related classes.
- **Classes**: Individual Java files containing code.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Java Project] --> B[src folder]
    A --> C[resources folder]
    B --> D[packages]
    D --> E[classes]
    C --> F[configuration files]
    C --> G[static resources]
```

### Explanation

Creating a well-structured project is the first step in Java development. It helps in organizing code, managing dependencies, and separating concerns. In this lab, we'll create a simple project structure.

### Code Example

```java
// File: src/com/example/iolab/Main.java
package com.example.iolab;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java I/O!");
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

Create the project structure as follows:
1. Create a folder named `resources` in your project root (i.e., at the same level as the `src` folder (NOT inside the `src` folder))
2. Create a package named "com.example.iolab".
3. In this package, create a class named `Main`.
4. Add a `main` method to the `Main` class and print "Hello, Java I/O!" to the console.
5. Run the program to ensure it works correctly.

## 2. Creating and Locating Files

### Concept Introduction: File Handling in Java

Java provides robust file handling capabilities through the `java.io` and `java.nio.file` packages. Understanding how to create, locate, and manipulate files is fundamental to I/O operations.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Java Application] --> B[java.io]
    A --> C[java.nio.file]
    B --> D[File handling]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Create files]
    D --> F[Locate files]
    D --> G[Manipulate files]
```

### Explanation

In Java, you can create files programmatically or manually. The `Path` interface from `java.nio.file` is the modern way to represent file and directory pathnames. In this lab, we'll create a file manually and use Java to locate it.

### Code Example

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.Files;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the project's root directory
        Path projectRoot = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
        
        // Construct the path to input.txt
        Path inputFilePath = projectRoot.resolve("resources").resolve("input.txt");
        
        // Check if the file exists
        if (Files.exists(inputFilePath)) {
            System.out.println("input.txt found at: " + inputFilePath.toAbsolutePath());
        } else {
            System.out.println("input.txt not found!");
        }
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

1. Create a new text file named "input.txt" and put it in the resources folder.
2. Open input.txt and type the following text: "Hello, Java I/O! This is a test file.", then save and close the file.
3. Modify your `main` method to print the absolute path of "input.txt" using the code example above.
4. Add error handling to your code to gracefully handle the case where the file doesn't exist.

## 3. Reading with Input Streams

### Concept Introduction: Input Streams

Input streams in Java are used to read data from a source, such as a file, network connection, or in-memory buffer. The base class for all input streams is `java.io.InputStream`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[InputStream] --> B[FileInputStream]
    A --> C[ByteArrayInputStream]
    B --> E[Read from files]
    C --> F[Read from memory]
```

### Explanation

`FileInputStream` is a concrete implementation of `InputStream` used specifically for reading bytes from files. It's useful for reading binary data or when you need low-level control over reading operations.

### Code Example (using try-catch-finally)

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "resources/input.txt";
        FileInputStream fis = null;
        
        try {
            fis = new FileInputStream(filePath);
            int data;
            while ((data = fis.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (fis != null) {
                    fis.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error closing file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

1. Implement the code to read from "input.txt" using `FileInputStream` with try-catch-finally.
2. Modify the code to count the number of characters in the file.
3. Add error handling for potential `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.
4. Print both the content of the file and the character count to the console.

## 4. Writing with Output Streams

### Concept Introduction: Output Streams

Output streams in Java are used to write data to a destination, such as a file, network connection, or in-memory buffer. The base class for all output streams is `java.io.OutputStream`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[OutputStream] --> B[FileOutputStream]
    A --> C[ByteArrayOutputStream]
    A --> D[Other specialized streams...]
    B --> E[Write to files]
    C --> F[Write to memory]
```

### Explanation

`FileOutputStream` is a concrete implementation of `OutputStream` used for writing bytes to files. It can create a new file or append to an existing file, making it versatile for various writing operations.

### Code Example (introducing try-with-resources)

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputPath = "resources/input.txt";
        String outputPath = "resources/output.txt";
        
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(inputPath);
             FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(outputPath)) {
            
            int data;
            while ((data = fis.read()) != -1) {
                fos.write(data);
            }
            System.out.println("File copied successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error copying file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

1. Implement the code to copy the content from "input.txt" to a new file "output.txt" using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` with try-with-resources.
2. Modify the code to append to "output.txt" instead of overwriting it.
3. Add a feature to convert all text to uppercase when writing to the output file.
4. Compare this implementation with the previous try-catch-finally approach and note the benefits of try-with-resources.

## 5. Character-based I/O with Readers and Writers

### Concept Introduction: Readers and Writers

While Input/Output streams deal with byte data, Readers and Writers are designed to work with character data, making them more suitable for text processing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Reader] --> B[FileReader]
    A --> C[StringReader]
    D[Writer] --> E[FileWriter]
    D --> F[StringWriter]
    B --> G[Read text from files]
    E --> H[Write text to files]
```

### Explanation

`FileReader` and `FileWriter` are character streams that are convenient for reading and writing text files. They internally handle the conversion between bytes and characters using the default character encoding.

### Code Example

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputPath = "resources/input.txt";
        String outputPath = "resources/output.txt";
        
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(inputPath);
             FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(outputPath)) {
            
            int character;
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                writer.write(Character.toUpperCase((char) character));
            }
            System.out.println("File copied and converted to uppercase.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

1. Modify your previous code to use `FileReader` and `FileWriter` instead of `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`.
2. Implement a feature to count the number of vowels in the input file.
3. Write a summary at the end of the output file that includes the total character count and vowel count.
4. Add proper exception handling and resource management using try-with-resources.

## 6. Buffered I/O Operations

### Concept Introduction: Buffered I/O

Buffered I/O operations improve performance by reducing the number of direct reads and writes to the underlying stream. They work by reading or writing chunks of data at a time, storing them in a buffer.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[BufferedReader] --> B[FileReader]
    C[BufferedWriter] --> D[FileWriter]
    A --> E[Read line by line]
    C --> F[Write with buffering]
    B --> G[Underlying file]
    D --> G
```

### Explanation

`BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` wrap around existing Readers and Writers, adding buffering capabilities. This can significantly improve performance, especially when reading or writing large amounts of data.

### Code Example

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputPath = "resources/input.txt";
        String outputPath = "resources/output.txt";
        
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputPath));
             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(outputPath))) {
            
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                writer.write(line.toUpperCase());
                writer.newLine();
            }
            System.out.println("File processed with buffered I/O.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### DIY Task

1. Update your code to use `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`.
2. Implement a word count feature that counts the number of words in the input file.
3. Modify the program to write every other word in uppercase to the output file.
4. Add a progress indicator that prints a dot to the console for every 100 words processed.

## 7. Introduction to File I/O with Streams

### Concept Introduction: Java Streams and File I/O

Java Streams, introduced in Java 8, provide a powerful and efficient way to process collections of data. When combined with file I/O operations, streams offer a modern and flexible approach to reading and processing file contents.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[File] --> B[Files.lines()]
    B --> C[Stream of Strings]
    C --> D[Filter]
    C --> E[Map]
    C --> F[Collect]
    D --> G[Processed Data]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

### Explanation

Java Streams allow us to process data in a declarative way, similar to SQL queries. When working with files, the `Files.lines()` method provides a convenient way to read a file line by line, returning a `Stream<String>`. This stream can then be processed using various operations like filtering, mapping, and collecting.

Key benefits of using streams for file I/O include:
1. Lazy evaluation: Streams process data on-demand, which can be more memory-efficient for large files.
2. Parallel processing: Streams can easily be parallelized for improved performance on multi-core systems.
3. Functional programming style: Streams encourage a more declarative and often more readable code style.

### Code Example

Let's look at a simple example that reads a file using streams and performs some basic operations:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputPath = "resources/input.txt";

        // Reading and counting lines
        try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(Paths.get(inputPath))) {
            long lineCount = lines.count();
            System.out.println("Number of lines: " + lineCount);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        // Reading and processing each line
        try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(Paths.get(inputPath))) {
            lines.forEach(line -> System.out.println("Line: " + line));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        // Filtering lines
        try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(Paths.get(inputPath))) {
            long nonEmptyLines = lines
                .filter(line -> !line.trim().isEmpty())
                .count();
            System.out.println("Non-empty lines: " + nonEmptyLines);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down this example:

1. `Files.lines(Paths.get(inputPath))`: This method reads the file and returns a Stream<String>, where each element is a line from the file.

2. `lines.count()`: This operation counts the number of lines in the file. It's a terminal operation, meaning it processes the entire stream and produces a result.

3. `lines.forEach(line -> ...)`: This operation processes each line individually. It's useful for performing actions on each line, like printing or more complex processing.

4. `lines.filter(line -> !line.trim().isEmpty()).count()`: This chain of operations filters out empty lines and then counts the remaining lines. It demonstrates how we can combine stream operations for more complex processing.

Note that we're using try-with-resources for each stream operation. This ensures that the file is properly closed after we're done processing it.

### DIY Task

1. Modify the example to count the number of words in the file. (Hint: You'll need to split each line into words.)

2. Implement a filter to count lines that contain a specific word of your choice.

3. Use streams to find the longest line in the file.

4. Create a simple word frequency counter that prints out the top 5 most common words in the file.

5. Bonus: Use `Files.list()` to get a stream of all text files in the resources directory, then process each file to count its lines.

These tasks will help you get familiar with basic stream operations in the context of file I/O. Remember, streams are a powerful tool for data processing, and mastering them will greatly enhance your Java programming skills.
